## Bioinformatics Scripts for Learning and Research

This repository contains bioinformatics scripts created to support my research and help me learn the basics of programming, particularly in the context of sequence analysis using BLAST and FASTA files.

Some parts of these scripts were generated or refined with the help of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) and then tested, adapted, and used in real research contexts.

This repository is part of my learning journey during my Master's Program in Bioinformatics at UNICAMP (Brazil).
