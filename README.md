## Bioinformatics Scripts for Learning and Research

This repository contains bioinformatics scripts created to support my research and help me learn the basics of programming, particularly in the context of sequence analysis using BLAST and FASTA files.

Some parts of these scripts were generated or refined with the help of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) and then tested, adapted, and used in real research contexts.

This repository is part of my learning journey during my Master's Program in Bioinformatics at UNICAMP (Brazil). 

## Data

The data used with these scripts is part of ongoing research and is not publicly available due to confidentiality.  
To run the scripts, you will need your own input files in the appropriate format (FASTA and BLAST XML).

> File names used in the scripts are placeholders (e.g., QUERY_FASTA, BLAST_XML) and should be replaced with your own data.
