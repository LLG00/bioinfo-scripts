## Bioinformatics Scripts for Learning and Research

This repository contains bioinformatics scripts developed to support my research and enhance my programming skills.

Some parts of these scripts were generated or refined with the help of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT), and were subsequently tested, adapted, and applied in real research contexts.

This repository reflects my learning journey as a bioinformatician and serves as a portfolio of my progress throughout my academic and professional development.

## Data

The data used with these scripts is part of ongoing research and is not publicly available due to confidentiality.  
To run the scripts, you will need your own input files in the appropriate format (FASTA and BLAST XML).

> File names used in the scripts are placeholders and should be replaced with your own data.
